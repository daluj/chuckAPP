# Project requirements
* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) or [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/download.html) server
* At least [PHP 7.3](https://www.php.net/releases/7_3_0.php)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## How to run it
1. Clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/daluj/chuckAPP.git
```
2. Create `.env` file by renaming `env.example` to `.env`
3. Set up the database using database environment variables on `.env` file. 
3. Run the following commands (on the project folder) to initialize project:
```
$ composer install
```

```
$ php artisan migrate
```

```
$ php artisan serve
```

Check the server is running on http://localhost:8001.

(or you can use Laravel/Homestead or XAMPP as development environments)

## Installation with Docker
```
$ docker-compose build app
```

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

```
$ docker-compose exec app composer install
```

```
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```

```
$ docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

Check your http://localhost and make sure it is running 

## Installation with Laravel/Homestead (recommended)
In order to set up the development environment in your local machine, [Laravel/Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead) provides a wonderful development environment without requiring to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine. 

I recommend installing [per-project](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead#per-project-installation)

## Installation with XAMPP
For [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) installation and set up, please check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9em7Ey00xQ)
